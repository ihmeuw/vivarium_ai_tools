**NOTE: This repository has been archived.**

Development has moved to the `vivarium-suite monorepo <https://github.com/ihmeuw/vivarium-suite>`_,
where this code now lives at ``tools/ai-tools/``.

Vivarium AI Tools is a Claude Code plugin providing custom agent
workflows for vivarium development. The repository is structured as
both a plugin and a single-plugin marketplace, so Claude Code users can
install it via the marketplace mechanism.

It includes:

**Code Reviewer**

- ``code_reviewer`` — orchestrator that delegates to specialist sub-agents
- ``_review_maintainability`` - sub-agent that reviews readability, documentation, implicit assumptions, and coupling
- ``_review_dry`` - sub-agent that identifies duplicated logic, missed abstractions, and repeated patterns
- ``_review_design`` - sub-agent that evaluates data structure choices, algorithmic efficiency, API surface, and representation trade-offs
- ``_review_tests`` - sub-agent that assesses test coverage, test quality, edge cases, and test naming and structure
- ``_review_documentation`` - sub-agent that checks docstring quality, accuracy, and completeness, as well as comments and changelog updates

Slash command (Claude Code only): ``/viv:code-review <PR or description>``.

**Regression Debugger**

- ``model_regression_debugger`` — orchestrator that traces data pipeline changes across repos to find the cause of simulation regressions
- ``_diff_analyzer`` — sub-agent that analyzes diffs in a single repo (run in parallel for multi-repo changes)
- ``_hypothesis_tester`` — sub-agent that tests a single hypothesis about a regression cause

Slash command (Claude Code only): ``/viv:debug-regression <symptom and context>``.

Repository Layout
=================

- ``.claude-plugin/plugin.json``: plugin manifest (auto-detected by VS Code Copilot)
- ``.claude-plugin/marketplace.json``: marketplace catalog so Claude Code can install this as a plugin
- ``agents/``: orchestrator agents (Copilot entry points) and specialist sub-agents
- ``commands/``: Claude Code slash commands
- project metadata files copied from ``vivarium_dependencies``

Installing in Claude Code
=========================

Add the marketplace and install the plugin:

.. code-block:: shell

   /plugin marketplace add ihmeuw/vivarium_ai_tools
   /plugin install viv@vivarium-ai-tools

For local development against a checked-out copy:

.. code-block:: shell

   /plugin marketplace add /path/to/vivarium_ai_tools
   /plugin install viv@vivarium-ai-tools

Once installed, the canonical Claude Code entry points are the slash
commands ``/viv:code-review`` and ``/viv:debug-regression``. These run
the parallel sub-agent fan-out at main-session level and produce a
multi-lens review or investigation.

The ``code_reviewer`` and ``model_regression_debugger`` agent files
exist for VS Code Copilot, which has no slash-command surface. On
Claude Code, if a user invokes them directly via ``@code_reviewer`` or
``@model_regression_debugger``, the agent's first step is to detect the
harness and output a one-line redirect telling the user to use the
slash command instead. Do not rely on the ``@`` invocation path on
Claude.

Delegation mechanism
====================

Sub-agent delegation works differently on each platform, and the plugin
uses two separate mechanisms that target the two harnesses
independently.

**Claude Code.** Sub-agents cannot spawn further sub-agents (per the
upstream `Claude Code sub-agents docs
<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents.md>`_), so the parallel
fan-out has to run at main-session level. That is what the
``commands/*.md`` slash commands do: their ``allowed-tools: Agent(...)``
field grants the main session permission to spawn the listed
``_review_*`` (or ``_diff_analyzer`` / ``_hypothesis_tester``)
sub-agents in parallel, and the slash command body is itself the
orchestration prompt. The orchestrator agent files are *not* invoked
by the slash command — the fan-out targets the specialist sub-agents
directly.

**VS Code Copilot.** Sub-agent delegation is the orchestrator's job
and is configured via two front-matter fields on the orchestrator
agent: ``tools:`` must contain the ``agent`` token, and an
``agents: [...]`` list enumerates allowed sub-agents. Both are
declared on ``code_reviewer`` and ``model_regression_debugger``.
Copilot has no slash-command surface; the agent picker is the only
entry point.

The orchestrator agent files use only Copilot tool vocabulary
(``read, search, execute, github/*, agent``) — Claude-style PascalCase
tokens are intentionally absent, because the canonical Claude path is
the slash command and there is no scenario where the orchestrator
agent would run usefully under Claude. The ``_review_*``,
``_diff_analyzer``, and ``_hypothesis_tester`` sub-agent files do
declare both vocabularies (they are invoked from both the Claude
slash command and from Copilot's orchestrators). Do not consolidate
these vocabularies — each platform recognizes its own tokens and
silently drops the other's, and the cross-platform compatibility
relies on both being present where applicable.

Security model and recommended deny rules
=========================================

The agents in this plugin have the following shell access on Claude
Code:

- The 5 ``_review_*`` sub-agents have **no Bash access at all**. They
  are fed PR context by the slash command and analyze code with
  ``Read``, ``Grep``, and ``Glob`` only.
- ``_diff_analyzer`` and ``_hypothesis_tester`` declare ``Bash`` to run
  ``git`` and ``gh`` commands. In practice, every operation they
  perform is a read-only git command (``git diff``, ``git log``,
  ``git show``, ``git status``), which Claude Code auto-approves via
  its built-in read-only command allowlist.
- The ``code_reviewer`` and ``model_regression_debugger`` orchestrator
  agents are Copilot-only and have no Claude tools — on Claude Code
  they redirect to the slash command and exit. The Bash work on the
  Claude path is performed by the slash command body itself (running
  in the main session), which similarly only invokes read-only git/gh
  commands to gather PR/repo context.

For destructive or out-of-scope commands, Claude Code's default
permission system prompts you before execution, so a prompt-injected
agent cannot silently run ``rm``, ``curl``, or similar without your
approval.

If you run with ``defaultMode: bypassPermissions`` or ``auto``, or
otherwise want an explicit deny floor that cannot be bypassed by an
errant prompt-allow, add this snippet to ``~/.claude/settings.json``:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "permissions": {
       "deny": [
         "Bash(git push *)",
         "Bash(git reset --hard *)",
         "Bash(git rebase *)",
         "Bash(git clean -fd *)",
         "Bash(gh repo delete *)",
         "Bash(gh auth logout *)",
         "Bash(gh pr close *)"
       ]
     }
   }

Deny rules take precedence over allow rules and over hook decisions, so
these will block the listed commands in every permission mode.

Installing in VS Code GitHub Copilot
====================================

Add this path to ``chat.pluginLocations`` in settings:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "chat.pluginLocations": {
       "/your/path/to/vivarium_ai_tools": true
     }
   }

Then reload VS Code and verify the plugin appears in the Agent Plugins
UI. The agents will appear in the Copilot agent picker. Slash commands
are intentionally Claude-only — Copilot's agent picker is the
equivalent surface there.
